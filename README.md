# foodboard-skeleton
Simple project that consists of an index  
listing dishes that show info when hovered  
and once clicked shows detail in a different  
page, the heart is clickable and that is it.

There is also the add new page that allows to  
upload the pic of the food and fill out info  

People can heart other people's dishes and that's it  
people can filter in the index what they want  
by price, hearts or proximity (maybe?).
